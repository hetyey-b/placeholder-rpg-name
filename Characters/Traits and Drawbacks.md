# Traits and Drawbacks

* Characters start with at least 1 pair of trait and drawback (maximum 3 pairs)
* Each pair has to have the same source:
    * Race
    * Homeland
    * Background
    * Story/General - (this is where the GM will add campaign specific traits)
* More can be added via character progression during downtime
* Supports the idea that all races are mixed with human to an extent, more or less orc blood can be represented by more or less orcish traits
