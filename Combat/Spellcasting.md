# Spellcasting Rules

## Components
* Spells use different components, that are added to the spell from the environment, or from materials by the spell caster
* When added, each component belongs to an element
* Spell level: number of components at the moment of casting

## Elements
* Opposite elements cancel each other out

* Fire  <=> Cold
* Water <=> Lightning
* Stone <=> Heal

## Effect of elements
* Fire:             lights flammable
* Cold:             freezes wet
* Water:            wets stuff
* Lightning:        extra damage to wet (& bounces around?)
* Stone:            can break objects, and push people
* Heal:             heals wounds

* Water + Cold:     becomes ice
* Fire + Stone:     becomes sand
* Lightning + Heal: chance to revive unconscious
