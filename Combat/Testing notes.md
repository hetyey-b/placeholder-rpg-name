# Balance testing

## 4v4, 20+D12 initiative, D20 to roll for success/hit, D8 Cascading damage, Movement = 1/square, Attack = 3
* Doesn't work. We need some kind of limit on how much you can spend in a turn.

## 4v4, 20+D12 initiative, D20 to roll for success/hit, D8 Cascading damage. Move 6 tiles for 3, Attack for 3, Charge (move "roughly straight" + attack) for 5
* How in the fuck do assists work?

## Assits/Interrupts: can be taken as a "reaction", if your initiative is before resolution time. Still costs normal initiative.
* Has potential, we need more rigid definitions on possible actions
