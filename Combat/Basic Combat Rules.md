# Basic Combat Rules

## Combat design philosophy basics
* We use grid based combat, where one tile represents a 1,5m x 1,5m square.
* Combat should be made as quick as possible.
* Most features of combat should encourage comboing with other players.

## Terminology
* Minion: Minor combatant, low level henchman. Doesn't do much damage, and dies easily.
* General: A named enemy, nearly as tough as player characters.
* Boss: A very powerful enemy, at least as tough as player characters, but probably more so.
